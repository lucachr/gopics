GoPics is a simple image sharing board built with Go, Redis, UIkit, and 
good intentions.  

The project goal is to built a simple Go web app that is bigger than the 
classics wiki or WebSocket chat examples but still small enough to be useful
for learning purpose.  

This is the first version of the app, it supports only login, forms validation, 
and images upload capabilities. Real time stuff with WebSocket coming soon!
